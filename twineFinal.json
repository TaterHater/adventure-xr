The ESC's Mission Statement (predating it's founding and construction) states that it, as well as it's citizens, are strong in their independence, with an emphasis on \"forging their own path\" and frequent mobility.\n\nRandom stuff:\n\n* It is the norm for people to constantly be moving from floor to floor, each floor has something slightly unique to shake things up, and the core motivation for citizens is to reach the secure and luxurious upper echelons of their society (a pipe dream).\n* Identity can be changed at will by it's citizens, anonymity is a right\n* Following the fracturing of the internet, the ESC has it's own unique network: NetESC. All members are anonymous with no way of seeing a throughline between posts (though job titles are shown when verification is necessary)\n* Traditional social websites have been replaced with direct communication between members.]\n---\n[[Start-&gt;Your Apartment]]",
