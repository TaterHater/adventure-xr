 Climate City. Lower Classes relegated to below sea level, while upper 
classes are privileged with exposure to sunlight. Uniform architecture, 
sturdy but narrow pyramids.

(link: "About the world")[Our story takes place in The Eastern Statenal 
Collective (E.S.C), a self sustaining megalopolis contained entirely 
within climate controlled towers. The ESC's Mission Statement (predating
 it's founding and construction) states that it, as well as it's 
citizens, are strong in their independence, with an emphasis on "forging
 their own path" and frequent mobility.

Random stuff:

* It is the norm for people to constantly be moving from floor to floor,
 each floor has something slightly unique to shake things up, and the 
core motivation for citizens is to reach the secure and luxurious upper 
echelons of their society (a pipe dream).
* Identity can be changed at will by it's citizens, anonymity is a right
* Following the fracturing of the internet, the ESC has it's own unique 
network: NetESC. All members are anonymous with no way of seeing a 
throughline between posts (though job titles are shown when verification
 is necessary)
* Traditional social websites have been replaced with direct 
communication between members.]

Nicola lets you in.

It's identical in design and layout to yours. Near the corner is a work

 thin, short-haired man.
